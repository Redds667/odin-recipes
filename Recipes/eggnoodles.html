        <p>These egg noodles are the old-fashioned type, just like Grammy used to make! Try them next time you prepare your favorite soup or stew. Don't forget that fresh pasta cooks much quicker than dried! You may use a dough hook attachment on your electric mixer or your hands to knead the pasta dough.</p>
        <h1>What are Egg Noodles?</h1>
        <p> Egg noodles are, unsurprisingly, noodles made with eggs. Egg noodles have more flavor than noodles made with just flour, water, and salt. They also tend to be stickier and more flexible than noodles made without eggs.</p>
        <h1>How to Make Egg Noodles</h1>
        <p>You'll find the full, step-by-step recipe below — but here’s a brief overview of what you can expect when you make homemade egg noodles:</p>
        <ol>
            <li>Stir the dry ingredients in one bowl, then stir in the wet ingredients.</li>
            <li>Knead the dough, then let it rest for 10 minutes.</li>
            <li>Roll out the dough, then cut it into the desired lengths and shapes.</li>
        </ol>
        <h1>How to Cook Egg Noodles</h1>

            <li>Knead dough until smooth, about 5 minutes. Let rest in a covered bowl for 10 minutes. </li>
            <li>On a floured surface, roll dough out to a thickness of 1/8 to 1/4 inch. Cut into desired lengths and shapes. </li>
